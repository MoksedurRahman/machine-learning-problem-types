## ðŸ”· 1. Supervised Learning Problems
Supervised learning involves labeled data. The model learns to map inputs to known outputs.

### a. Classification
**Goal:** Predict discrete labels (e.g., categories)

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [Heart Disease Prediction](https://github.com/MoksedurRahman/heart_disease_classification) | Predict heart disease from medical attributes |
| [Spam Detection] | Detect whether an email is spam or not |

### b. Regression
**Goal:** Predict continuous numeric values

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [House Price Prediction](https://github.com/MoksedurRahman/california-housing-price-prediction) | Predict house prices based on features like location and area |
| [Fuel Consumption](https://github.com/MoksedurRahman/fuel-consumption-analysis) | Estimate fuel usage based on engine and vehicle metrics |

---

## ðŸ”· 2. Unsupervised Learning Problems
Unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data.

### a. Clustering
**Goal:** Group similar data points together

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [Customer Segmentation](./2-unsupervised-learning/clustering/customer-segmentation) | Group customers by purchasing behavior |
| [Market Basket Analysis](./2-unsupervised-learning/clustering/market-basket-analysis) | Identify product buying patterns |

### b. Dimensionality Reduction
**Goal:** Reduce features while preserving structure

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [PCA on MNIST](./2-unsupervised-learning/dimensionality-reduction/pca-visualization) | Visualize high-dimensional digit data |
| [t-SNE Visualization](./2-unsupervised-learning/dimensionality-reduction/tsne-mnist) | Nonlinear dimensionality reduction for complex patterns |

---

## ðŸ”· 3. Semi-Supervised Learning
Use both labeled and a large amount of unlabeled data.

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [Semi-supervised Medical Imaging](./3-semi-supervised-learning/medical-imaging-semi-label) | Classify diseases with few labeled images |

---

## ðŸ”· 4. Reinforcement Learning
Learn by interacting with an environment and maximizing reward.

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [Grid World Q-Learning](./4-reinforcement-learning/grid-world-qlearning) | Simple RL agent learning to navigate grid |

---

## ðŸ”· 5. Self-Supervised Learning
Learn representations using unlabeled data and pseudo-labels.

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [SimCLR - Image Representations](./5-self-supervised-learning/image-representation-simclr) | Contrastive learning for image features |

---

## ðŸ”· 6. Time Series Forecasting
Predict future values from historical time-series data.

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [Sales Forecasting](./6-time-series-forecasting/sales-forecasting) | Predict monthly sales using LSTM |
| [Weather Prediction](./6-time-series-forecasting/weather-prediction) | Forecast weather conditions |

---

## ðŸ”· 7. Anomaly Detection
Detect unusual patterns or outliers.

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [Credit Card Fraud Detection](./7-anomaly-detection/credit-card-fraud) | Identify fraudulent transactions |
| [Network Intrusion Detection](./7-anomaly-detection/network-intrusion-detection) | Detect suspicious network activity |
